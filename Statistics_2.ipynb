        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. It helps determine whether there is enough evidence to support a certain belief or claim (called a hypothesis). The process involves comparing sample data with what we would expect if a specific claim about the population were true.\n",
